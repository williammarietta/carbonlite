# CarbonLite (simple CO2 trip calculator + other)

This is just a tiny program I made to see how much CO2 my trips make and what I'd save if I switched some of them to bus/bike/walk/train. It saves stuff into a CSV so I can look at it later.

## What it does
- I type how many miles a trip was and what I used (car, bus, bike, etc).
- It tells me the CO2 for that trip.
- Then I can pick a cleaner option and see how much I'd save each week if I switched 1â€“3 days.
- It logs everything to `logs/trips.csv`.
